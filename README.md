# War

## Object of the Game

Take all of your opponent's cards.

## Gameplay

### Taking a Turn

1. Click on the deck near the bottom of your screen (henceforth "player one's deck") to reveal each player's top card.

1. The player with the higher card wins! Click on player one's discard pile (to the left of player one's deck) to award the two cards to the winner of the battle.

1. Repeat steps one and two until the victory condition is met. Note: repetition of steps one and two will be interrupted if the two revealed cards tie. In this case, a war is declared!

### War

In the event of a tie, the players enter into war. Each player will reveal four more cards. The last card each player reveals (henceforth "decision card") decides who wins the "war". The player with the higher decision card takes **all** the cards that have been revealed.

Click on player one's decision card (to the upper right of player one's deck) to resolve the war.

### Victory

The first player to have all fifty-four cards wins!
