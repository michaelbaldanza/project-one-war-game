## War

A fifty-four card deck is shuffled and split in two. Each player places a card on the field of play. The player with the higher value card wins the "battle", and takes both cards into his discard pile.

In the event of a tie, each player will stake three further cards, then decides who wins the entire pot (ten cards total!), by a fourth. In this game, any further ties will be decided in the second player's favour. Sorry player one!
